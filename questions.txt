It should be cin >> x; instead
If you want to read from the keyboard you need to use cout, not cin
You can't read from the keyboard in C++
It is missing a semicolon at the end of the line

What is the benefit of doing separate compilation? I.e., keeping multiple .cc files instead of having everything in a single file.
While it doesn't go faster the first time, it speeds up compilation later when you're just editing one file at a time
The first time you compile it it goes faster
It prevents linker errors
It reduces the number of logic errors in your code, such as by making if statements more likely to be correct

C++ does not know how to << variables of the Artist type unless you tell it how
It should be "cout >> tool;" instead
You can't initialize aggregate types using {} notation

What is wrong with this class declaration? It will hold information on an audio track, including the name and length of the tune.\nstruct Track:\nstring name;\nint duration;\n};

What would happen if I moved the line marked "HERE" to "THERE"? In other words, it will be one line above the recursive call to print_happy_name() rather than one line after it.\nvoid print_happy_name(string s) {\nif (s.length() == 0) return;\nchar c = s.back();\ns.pop_back();\nprint_happy_name(s);\ncout << (char)toupper(c) << "??";\n}
It will print the name backwards instead of forwards
It will run into an infinite loop
It will only print the last letter of the name
It will fail to compile
